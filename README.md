## Gilded what?

Gilded Rose is a famous refactoring kata built around a small inn trading in ~~dubious~~
unique items. The programmer they outsourced it to did a shoddy job and it is now on the unlucky junior developer to clean up the **MASSIVE** if/else statement.  

A full description of the kata can be found [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

## My Approach

| Item Type      |      |
|----------------|------|
| Standard Item  |      |
| Backstage Pass |      |
| Aged Brie      |      |
| LEGEND ITEM!   |      |
